## Estimate Skill

You can create downloadable PDF estimates for customers with consistent, standardized pricing backed by real industry labor time data and real-time parts pricing.

### When to Use
- Customer asks "how much for X?" or "what would it cost?"
- Customer wants a price breakdown before committing
- Use estimates for informal pricing; use quotes for formal commitments

### Requirements
Before creating an estimate, you MUST have:
1. Customer record (use get_customer or create_customer first)
2. Vehicle info (make, model, year) - needed for accurate pricing, labor lookup, AND parts lookup
3. Clear understanding of services needed

### Flow
1. Gather vehicle info (year, make, model) and understand the issue
2. Look up or create customer record
3. **CRITICAL**: Use \`lookup_labor_time\` to get real industry labor hours for the customer's specific vehicle and service
4. **CRITICAL**: Use \`lookup_parts_price\` to get real-time parts pricing from RockAuto for the customer's specific vehicle
5. Determine applicable fees and discounts (see below)
6. Call \`create_estimate\` with all the data
7. Present the download link to the customer
8. Ask if they'd like to proceed with a formal quote

### OLP Labor Lookup (IMPORTANT)
We have the Open Labor Project database with industry-standard labor times for 4,400+ vehicles. **Always look up labor hours before estimating.**

- Call \`lookup_labor_time\` with the customer's year, make, model, and the service name
- It returns labor hours per engine variant (e.g., 2.5L I4 vs 3.5L V6 may differ)
- If the customer's engine is unknown, use the most common variant or present the range
- Use \`list_vehicle_services\` to see all available service categories for a vehicle
- If OLP has no data for the specific service, estimate labor hours based on industry knowledge

### Parts Lookup (IMPORTANT)
We have real-time parts pricing via RockAuto. **Always look up parts pricing before estimating.**

- Call \`lookup_parts_price\` with the customer's year, make, model, and the part name
- Returns tiered pricing (economy / daily driver / premium)
- Use "daily driver" tier as default unless customer specifies otherwise
- Pass the parts cost (in dollars) to \`create_estimate\` — the system applies tiered markup automatically

### Pricing Structure

**Labor:** hourlyRate × laborHours (from OLP)
**Parts:** tiered markup on OEM cost (40% under $50, 30% $50-200, 20% $200-500, 15% over $500)

**Fees (automatically applied by create_estimate):**
- **Shop supplies:** 5% of labor cost (max $25) — always included
- **Hazmat disposal ($15):** set \`involvesHazmat: true\` for oil changes, coolant flush, brake fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid
- **Tire disposal ($5/tire):** set \`tireCount\` for tire replacement services
- **Battery core charge ($25):** set \`involvesBattery: true\` for battery replacement
- **Travel fee:** if customer is beyond 15 miles, pass \`travelMiles\` — $1/mile beyond base
- **Rush fee ($75):** set \`isRush: true\` for same-day requests
- **After-hours ($50):** set \`isAfterHours: true\` for appointments after 6pm
- **Early morning ($25):** set \`isEarlyMorning: true\` for appointments before 8am
- **Weekend ($35):** set \`isWeekend: true\` for Saturday
- **Sunday ($50):** set \`isSunday: true\` for Sunday
- **Holiday ($100):** set \`isHoliday: true\` for holidays

**Discounts (pass \`discountType\`):**
- \`returning_customer\` — 5% off
- \`referral\` — 10% off
- \`fleet\` — 15% off (5+ vehicles)
- \`senior\` — 10% off (65+)
- \`military\` — 10% off
- \`first_responder\` — 10% off
- Multi-service (3+ services) — automatic 10% off

### When to Apply Fees
- **Always ask about scheduling** to determine time surcharges
- **Check customer location** for travel fees — ask if they're within the service area
- **Infer hazmat/tire/battery** from the service type — don't ask the customer, you should know
- **Check customer history** for returning customer discount
- **Ask about military/senior/first-responder** status only if relevant context suggests it

### Response Format
After creating an estimate, present the PDF link and a clear breakdown showing:
1. Service line items (labor + parts)
2. Fees (shop supplies, disposal, travel, scheduling)
3. Discount (if any)
4. Total range

Then ALWAYS use ask_user_question to offer next steps:
- "Send formal quote" — to email a Stripe quote
- "Book appointment" — to schedule the service
- "Adjust services" — to modify the estimate

Do NOT write these options as text. Call ask_user_question with them as buttons.
