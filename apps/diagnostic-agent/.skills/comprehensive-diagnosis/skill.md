# Comprehensive Diagnosis Skill

Use this skill when you have multiple types of input (photos, audio, video, OBD codes) and need to synthesize a complete diagnosis.

## Synthesis Process

### 1. Gather All Evidence
Collect findings from all input types:
- Photo analysis results
- Audio transcriptions and interpretations
- Video frame analysis and motion observations
- OBD code interpretations

### 2. Cross-Reference Symptoms
Look for connections between different inputs:
- Does the OBD code explain the sound?
- Does the photo show damage related to the video symptom?
- Do multiple inputs point to the same system?

### 3. Identify Patterns
- **Confirming evidence**: Multiple inputs supporting same diagnosis
- **Conflicting evidence**: Inputs that don't align (investigate further)
- **Missing evidence**: What additional info would help

### 4. Determine Root Cause vs Symptoms
Many vehicle problems cascade:
- A coolant leak (root cause) → overheating → head gasket damage (symptom)
- Worn strut (root cause) → tire cupping (symptom)
- Low oil (root cause) → lifter tick → timing chain wear (symptoms)

Identify the original problem that caused the chain of issues.

## Priority Classification

### Critical (Stop Driving Immediately)
- Brake system failures
- Steering component failures
- Active fluid leaks affecting safety systems
- Engine/transmission about to fail
- Overheating with head gasket symptoms

### High (Service Within Days)
- Brake pads near metal-to-metal
- Significant fluid leaks
- Wheel bearing noise
- CV joint failure imminent
- Check engine light with drivability issues

### Medium (Service Within Weeks)
- Maintenance due items
- Minor leaks
- Non-critical warning lights
- Noise/vibration affecting comfort
- Declining performance

### Low (Monitor and Schedule)
- Cosmetic issues
- Future maintenance items
- Minor symptoms to watch
- Parts showing wear but functional

## Repair Complexity Assessment

### DIY Friendly
- Air filter replacement
- Spark plug replacement
- Battery replacement
- Wiper blades
- Light bulbs
- Simple sensor cleaning

### Intermediate (Experienced DIY)
- Brake pad replacement
- Serpentine belt
- Thermostat
- Some sensors
- Fluid flushes

### Professional Required
- Timing belt/chain
- Head gasket
- Transmission work
- Suspension components
- Electrical diagnosis
- AC system work

## Report Structure

When providing a comprehensive diagnosis, structure as follows:

### Summary
Brief overview of the main issue(s) found.

### Evidence Review
What was observed across all inputs.

### Primary Diagnosis
The main issue identified:
- What it is
- Evidence supporting it
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Severity rating

### Secondary Issues
Other problems found (if any):
- Each issue with severity and evidence

### Root Cause Analysis
If issues are related, explain the chain of causation.

### Repair Priority
1. What must be done immediately
2. What should be scheduled soon
3. What can wait/be monitored

### Cost Considerations
- DIY vs professional
- Parts that may be needed
- Preventive vs reactive repair choice

### Follow-Up
- What to monitor after repairs
- When to reassess
- Preventive maintenance to consider

## Example Response

"## Comprehensive Diagnosis Report

### Summary
Your vehicle has a failing wheel bearing (right front) and worn brake pads on the front axle. The grinding noise you recorded is primarily the wheel bearing, not the brakes.

### Evidence Review
- **Audio**: Rhythmic grinding that increases with speed, louder on right turns
- **Photo**: Front brake pads show 3mm remaining, rotors have minor scoring
- **OBD Codes**: No codes present
- **Video**: Slight vibration visible in steering wheel at highway speed

### Primary Diagnosis: Right Front Wheel Bearing
**Confidence: High**

The sound characteristics (speed-dependent, changes with turning) combined with the steering vibration are textbook wheel bearing symptoms. The noise being louder when turning right indicates the right side bearing, as this loads weight onto the failing bearing.

**Severity: High** - Wheel bearings can seize, causing loss of vehicle control.

### Secondary Issue: Front Brake Pads
**Confidence: High**

The photos show approximately 3mm of pad material remaining. While not immediately dangerous, replacement should be scheduled.

**Severity: Medium** - Good for another 2,000-3,000 miles with normal driving.

### Root Cause Analysis
These issues are not related. The wheel bearing failure is likely due to age/mileage. The brake wear is normal maintenance.

### Repair Priority
1. **Immediate**: Wheel bearing replacement (avoid highway driving)
2. **Within 1 month**: Front brake pad replacement
3. **Optional**: Consider replacing brake rotors with pads for best results

### Cost Considerations
- Wheel bearing: $150-300 parts, 1-2 hours labor. Requires press, not DIY-friendly.
- Brake pads: $30-80 parts, DIY possible with basic tools
- Rotors: Add $60-120 if replacing

### Follow-Up
After wheel bearing replacement, test drive at highway speed to confirm noise is resolved. Monitor brake feel and schedule pad replacement before wear indicators contact rotors."
