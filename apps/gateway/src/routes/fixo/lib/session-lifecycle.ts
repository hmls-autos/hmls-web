 * Re-open a previously-finalized session when its OWNER keeps interacting.
 *
 * After /complete writes status='complete' + result, follow-up activity (a
 * new /task turn or another /sessions/:id/input) means the prior diagnosis
 * is stale: the new conversation deserves a fresh report. Flip the row back
 * to 'processing' and null out result/completedAt so /complete's cache
 * short-circuit doesn't return the stale snapshot on the next Report click.
 *
 * The auth predicate is folded into the WHERE clause so an attacker passing
 * another user's session id can't wipe their completed report. Single atomic
 * UPDATE, cheap to call on hot paths. No-op if the session isn't 'complete'
 * or if the caller doesn't own it.
