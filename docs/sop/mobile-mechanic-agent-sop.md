## Technical Integration

POST /task
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-User-Context: {"id": 1, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com", "phone": "555-1234"}

Body: AG-UI message format
```

### User Context Header

The web frontend injects user context via `X-User-Context` header:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567"
}
```

The agent appends this to the system prompt as:
```
## Current Customer

- Customer ID: 1
```

### Known Issues

**Database Query Errors**

If the agent reports database errors when calling tools:

1. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose up -d postgres`
2. Check database connection: `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"`
3. Ensure tables are seeded: Check that `services` table has data

**Tool Definition Format**

All tools must use consistent format with `schema` (not `parameters`) for Zod validation:

```typescript
export const myTool = {
  name: "my_tool",
  description: "...",
  schema: z.object({ ... }),  // Use 'schema', not 'parameters'
  execute: async (params, _ctx) => { ... }
};
```

**Missing Environment Variables**

Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `CALCOM_API_KEY`
- `CALCOM_EVENT_TYPE_ID`
